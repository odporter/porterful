# Porterful — Bucket A UX Patch Implementation

All four Bucket A fixes from the patch prep landed in the working tree. Lint, layout-guards, and `next build` all pass. No DB, Stripe, payout, rights gate, image upload, music ordering, or apparel catalog logic was touched.

## Files changed

| File | Fix(es) |
|---|---|
| `src/app/page.tsx` | A1 |
| `src/app/(app)/settings/settings/page.tsx` | A2 |
| `src/lib/artist-social.tsx` *(new)* | A3 (shared icon + URL helper) |
| `src/components/artist/ArtistHero.tsx` | A3 |
| `src/app/(app)/artist/artist/[id]/page.tsx` | A3 + A4 |

The slug route (`src/app/(app)/artist/[slug]/page.tsx`) was **not** modified — it already renders DB-first via `mergeArtistData` in `src/lib/artist-db.ts`, which uses `dbValue || staticValue` (DB-first). It now also picks up the unified social rendering automatically because `ArtistHero` imports the shared helper.

## What each fix changed

### A1 — Homepage logged-in CTA
- Imported `useSupabase` from `@/app/providers` (same source the Navbar uses).
- Mirrored the Navbar's `mounted && !loading` readiness pattern with `authReady`, `showUser`, `showGuest` flags.
- Hero CTA now branches:
  - Guest → `Create your account` linking to `/login` (unchanged copy).
  - Authenticated → `Go to Dashboard` linking to `/dashboard/artist` (matches Navbar's `dashboardHref`/`dashboardLabel`).
  - Pre-ready → small skeleton placeholder, prevents flash of wrong CTA.
- "Start Listening" remains the primary CTA in both states.
- No auth architecture change — only consumes existing context.

### A2 — Settings contrast cleanup
Replaced ad-hoc Tailwind colors that hardcoded a dark-theme assumption with Porterful tokens, so the page reads correctly in dark, light, and warm/sepia themes:
- Outer container `text-white` → `text-[var(--pf-text)]` (loading state and main wrapper).
- All `border-gray-700` on inputs → `border-[var(--pf-border)]` (replaced repo-wide via `replace_all` in this single file).
- All non-button `text-gray-500` (helper text, "no payouts yet", "no referral code", notification descriptions, file-size hint, disabled email input) → `text-[var(--pf-text-muted)]`.
- "Copy Link" button on `bg-[var(--pf-surface)]` was `text-white` (illegible on light surfaces) → now `text-[var(--pf-text)]` with a `border-[var(--pf-border)]` so it's visible on both light and dark themes.
- Intentionally **kept** `text-white` on the four `bg-[var(--pf-orange)]` action buttons (Upload Photo, Save Changes, Copy code, Play All) and on the `bg-[#635bff]` Stripe `S` badge — white-on-color contrast is correct in any theme.
- Layout, spacing, structure, and the toggle switch styling are unchanged.

### A3 — TikTok / social icon unification
- New `src/lib/artist-social.tsx` exports:
  - `InstagramIcon`, `TwitterIcon`, `YouTubeIcon`, `TikTokIcon` SVG components (single source of truth for the icon paths).
  - `SOCIAL_ICONS` map keyed by platform.
  - `normalizeSocialUrl(platform, value)` that handles `null`, full `http(s)` URLs, `@handle` strings, and bare handles uniformly across platforms.
  - `normalizeArtistSocials(input)` for batch normalization.
- `ArtistHero.tsx` now imports the icon set, types, and `normalizeSocialUrl` from the helper instead of defining its own. The hero pill styling is unchanged. Filtered `socialEntries` now also requires the platform key to exist in `SOCIAL_ICONS` so legacy keys (e.g. `website`) can't render a phantom button.
- `artist/artist/[id]/page.tsx` no longer ships an inline TikTok SVG or inline Twitter SVG. Both render via `<TikTokIcon />` / `<TwitterIcon />` from the shared helper. The colored pink/blue tint on those icons was replaced with `text-[var(--pf-text-secondary)] hover:text-[var(--pf-text)]`, matching the YouTube/Instagram surfaces on this page and the hero treatment. The unused `Twitter` import from `lucide-react` was removed.
- The `id` route now also uses `normalizeSocialUrl` for both DB-sourced and static-fallback social handles, so `https://`-prefixed handles, raw `@handles`, and bare hostnames all resolve to the same canonical URL on both surfaces.

### A4 — Artist profile DB-first render
Targeted at the `artist/artist/[id]/page.tsx` `loadArtistData` block (the location of Codex's confirmed bio-revert bug). The slug page was already DB-first via `mergeArtistData` and needed no edit.

- Removed the bio-length heuristic. Was: `useBio = dbBio.length < fullBio.length ? (fullBio || dbBio) : dbBio` (this is what made saved bios appear to revert when shorter than the static seed). Now: `bio: dbBio || staticArtist?.bio || ''` — DB value wins whenever it's non-empty; static is a seed fallback only.
- Removed the parallel location-length heuristic. Now: `location: dbLocation || staticArtist?.location || ''`.
- Website now reads `data.profile.website_url || data.profile.website` so it picks up the live `artists.website_url` shape that the PATCH route writes (with a tolerant fallback to a legacy `website` field if any older rows have it).
- TikTok now reads `data.profile.tiktok_url` first, then falls back to `staticArtist?.social?.tiktok`. The `tiktok_url` column already exists on the `artists` table (written by the application/onboard flows), so this needs no schema change. Note: the artist edit form does not yet expose a TikTok input, so saved-from-edit-form TikTok updates are still out of band; the page will display whatever DB or static currently holds.
- Static catalog (`src/lib/artists.ts`) was **not** modified. Per Codex and the patch prep, it remains as seed/default content only.
- `mergeArtistData` (`src/lib/artist-db.ts`) was **not** modified — it already uses `dbValue || staticValue` (DB-first), so the slug route is correct as-is.

## Verification results

Run from `~/Documents/porterful`:

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm run lint` | ✅ pass — only pre-existing warnings (none from this patch). |
| `npm run check-layouts` | ✅ pass — `Layout guard passed — no document roots in route group layouts`. |
| `npm run build` | ✅ `✓ Compiled successfully`. All routes generated. |

Pre-existing warnings surfaced by lint/build (unchanged by this patch):
- `<img>`-vs-`<Image />` warnings in `checkout/checkout/page.tsx`, `settings/settings/page.tsx:326` (the avatar preview — this code path was not modified here), `checkout/page.tsx`, `ArtistProducts.tsx`.
- `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` in `payout`, `settings/settings`, `album-order`, `tracks/[id]/edit`.
- One Next.js dynamic-server info on `/api/likeness/verify`.

None of these were introduced by Bucket A.

### Browser-level verification not yet performed
I did not run `npm run dev` and exercise the UI. The four routes that should be visually checked before merge:
- `/` — logged-out shows "Create your account"; logged-in shows "Go to Dashboard" → `/dashboard/artist`.
- `/settings/settings` — toggle through dark / light / sepia themes; verify all four tabs (Profile, Referrals, Payouts, Notifications) have readable text on cards.
- `/artist/<slug>` — hero socials render via the shared icons; bio/socials reflect DB.
- `/artist/artist/<id>` — inline name-row socials render via the shared icons; bio/socials/website reflect DB; saving an edit and reloading the public page should now persist.

## Remaining parked items

These were **not** implemented in Bucket A and remain awaiting OD's go-ahead:

1. **Image upload runtime verification** (Codex §2). Code path is wired (`/api/upload` → Supabase storage on the `music` bucket). Likely failure mode is storage policy / public URL config for image MIME types, not application code. Needs a live upload test from `/dashboard/artist/edit` against production-like storage before any code change is justified.
2. **Playback snapshot before Stripe redirect** (Codex §3). Confirmed gap in `FeaturedTrackCard.tsx` and `ArtistTrackList.tsx` — direct buy buttons skip `savePlaybackSnapshot()`. Patch would be component-only (no Stripe change), but it was not in OD's four priority candidates and stays parked.
3. **Music / search ordering centralization** (Codex §7). Not a simple curated change — requires a shared helper consumed by `music/page.tsx`, `lib/artists.ts`, and `api/search/route.ts`. Excluded by hard rule.
4. **Product catalog placeholder cleanup** (Codex §8). Apparel surfaces — excluded by hard rule.
5. **Pretext editorial engine** — explicitly excluded; reserved as future inspiration.

## Hard-rule compliance statement

This patch did **not**:
- touch Stripe / checkout backend
- touch checkout UI flow
- touch payout copy or payout architecture
- touch the rights gate
- touch DB migrations or introduce new schema
- touch image upload code (`/api/upload` or related routes)
- change music or search ordering
- touch the apparel / product catalog
- add Pretext

Auth architecture was not altered — A1 only consumes the existing `useSupabase` context the Navbar already uses. The `tiktok_url` column read in A4 uses a column that already exists in the `artists` table (written by the application/onboard flows), so no schema or migration change was required.

## Risks and rollback

- **A4 carries the highest residual risk** because the `artist/artist/[id]/page.tsx` route is the public-facing artist profile and the change drops a fallback that previously masked a partial DB bio with a static one. If a row exists in DB with a one-character bio, the UI will now show that one character rather than the static seed. That's the correct DB-first behavior per Codex's audit and OD's directive, but worth noting before staging review.
- **A3 visually changes the `id` route's TikTok and Twitter icons** from colored (pink/blue) to neutral text-secondary, matching the rest of the surface. If OD wants the colored brand tints back, that is a one-line className change per icon.
- **Rollback is per-file**: each fix is contained to the file list above. No DB writes occurred. `git checkout -- <files>` (or revert each commit if committed individually) restores prior state.

## Suggested commit split

If OD wants atomic commits before merge, the natural splits are:

1. `feat(home): show "Go to Dashboard" CTA when logged in` — `src/app/page.tsx`.
2. `fix(settings): use Porterful text/border tokens for theme-safe contrast` — `src/app/(app)/settings/settings/page.tsx`.
3. `refactor(artist): unify social icon + URL handling via shared helper` — new `src/lib/artist-social.tsx`, `src/components/artist/ArtistHero.tsx`, `src/app/(app)/artist/artist/[id]/page.tsx` (icon swap portion only).
4. `fix(artist): DB-first bio/location/website/tiktok on /artist/artist/[id]` — `src/app/(app)/artist/artist/[id]/page.tsx` (the `loadArtistData` rewrite).

Edits 3 and 4 happen to overlap on the `id` route file; if OD prefers, they can ship as one commit ("artist profile: shared social helper + DB-first render").

Awaiting OD review.

## Codex Review Revisions (2026-05-03, post-review)

After Codex's WARNING-level review (`docs/CODEX_REVIEW_CLAUDE_BUCKET_A_UX_PATCH_2026-05-03.md`), OD authorized a targeted second pass to address Codex's two acknowledged concerns and the partial-icon-unification note. **Option 1 was selected: do not revert or reset `src/app/page.tsx`** — see "page.tsx investigation" below.

### Files changed in this pass

| File | What changed |
|---|---|
| `src/lib/artist-social.tsx` | (none — no edits this pass) |
| `src/lib/artist-db.ts` | Added DB-first `tiktok_url` mapping in both branches of `mergeArtistData` |
| `src/app/(app)/artist/artist/[id]/page.tsx` | Replaced remaining Lucide `Instagram` and `Youtube` social-row icons with shared `InstagramIcon` / `YouTubeIcon`; dropped colored brand tints to match the unified neutral treatment used by Twitter/TikTok and the hero |

### page.tsx investigation — what was reverted (nothing)

Codex's review attributed the homepage `HOME_FEATURED_TRACKS` reshape to my A1 patch and recommended reverting it. Investigation showed otherwise:

- `git log --oneline -- src/app/page.tsx` — most recent committed touch is `622c0833 Feature ATM Trap on homepage` (OD, 2026-05-03 02:46), which was a one-line slug swap (`gune` → `atm-trap`) on the existing `featuredArtist` constant. The `HOME_FEATURED_TRACKS` array did not exist in any committed state.
- `git diff origin/main -- src/app/page.tsx` — diff hunks show two distinct changes in the working tree: (a) the `featuredArtist`-style block was replaced by a curated `HOME_FEATURED_TRACKS` array and the first card was reshaped (wider span, larger image, "Featured track" label, larger title); (b) the auth CTA branching this patch added.
- The `HOME_FEATURED_TRACKS` block was already present the very first time I read this file at the start of A1 — it predates the auth CTA work.

**Conclusion: the featured-track reshape is pre-existing uncommitted work in OD's tree, not part of Claude's Bucket A patch.** Per OD's directive (Option 1), `src/app/page.tsx` was **not** reset or reverted — doing so would have destructively overwritten OD's in-progress reshape. Only the auth CTA behavior remains attributed to Bucket A in this file.

### What was fixed in this pass

#### Slug-route TikTok DB mapping (Codex §A4 WARNING)
- `src/lib/artist-db.ts:81` — added `...(dbArtist.tiktok_url && { tiktok: dbArtist.tiktok_url })` to the social merge in `mergeArtistData`. DB value now overrides static seed when present.
- `src/lib/artist-db.ts:58` — added `tiktok: dbArtist.tiktok_url` to the no-static-fallback branch so DB-only artists also expose TikTok.
- `ArtistData.social.tiktok` is already typed in `src/lib/artists.ts`. `ArtistTabs` already supports the `tiktok` field. No schema change.
- Net effect: `/artist/<slug>` now renders DB `tiktok_url` through `ArtistHero`'s social row consistently with `/artist/artist/<id>`.

#### Public artist icon unification (Codex §A3 WARNING)
- `src/app/(app)/artist/artist/[id]/page.tsx` — replaced the Lucide `Instagram` and `Youtube` social-row icons with shared `InstagramIcon` and `YouTubeIcon` from `src/lib/artist-social.tsx`. All four platform icons (Instagram, Twitter/X, YouTube, TikTok) on this surface now come from the shared helper, matching `ArtistHero`'s source.
- Brand-color tints (`text-pink-400`, `text-red-500`) on the social-row icons were dropped in favor of `text-[var(--pf-text-secondary)] hover:text-[var(--pf-text)]` to match Twitter/TikTok and the hero's neutral treatment.
- Lucide `Youtube` is **still** used in this file for non-social-link contexts: the "Music Videos" tab section heading, the empty-state large icon, and the "YouTube Channel" deep-link button. Those remain Lucide because they're decorative section icons, not platform link affordances. Lucide `Instagram` is fully removed from this file's imports.
- No layout, route, or data-fetching change.

### Verification results (post-revisions)

Run from `~/Documents/porterful`:

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm run lint` | ✅ pass — pre-existing warnings only (unchanged from earlier run). |
| `npm run check-layouts` | ✅ `Layout guard passed — no document roots in route group layouts`. |
| `npm run build` | ✅ `✓ Compiled successfully` — 166 routes generated. |

### Explicit scope statement

This revision pass:
- did **not** touch Stripe, checkout backend, payout copy or logic, the rights gate, DB migrations, image upload, music ordering, or the apparel/product catalog;
- did **not** add Pretext;
- did **not** change `src/app/page.tsx` — the featured-track reshape there is pre-existing OD work and was preserved verbatim;
- did **not** change `src/lib/artists.ts` (static catalog stays seed-only);
- did **not** change auth architecture;
- did **not** introduce a schema change (TikTok now reads through an existing `artists.tiktok_url` column already populated by application/onboard write paths).

The only newly attributable changes in this revision pass are the four-line `tiktok_url` merge addition in `artist-db.ts` and the icon-source swap in `artist/artist/[id]/page.tsx`.

Awaiting OD merge call.

## Post-Commit Verification Clarification (2026-05-03, after Codex post-commit review)

After Codex's post-commit review returned HOLD PUSH on the basis that commit `a4236fd0` allegedly still contained the `HOME_FEATURED_TRACKS` / featured-card reshape in `src/app/page.tsx`, the commit was independently rechecked with `git show HEAD -- src/app/page.tsx`.

### What the commit actually contains for `src/app/page.tsx`

The commit's `src/app/page.tsx` diff (range `a726a1f4..3b2c4310`) is auth-CTA-only:

- `+import { useSupabase } from '@/app/providers'`
- `+const { user, loading: authLoading } = useSupabase()`
- `+const authReady = mounted && !authLoading` plus `showUser` / `showGuest` flags
- The hero CTA `<div>` block updated to branch `Go to Dashboard` (signed-in) vs `Create your account` (guest), with a small skeleton placeholder while auth is resolving
- Whitespace-only cleanup on the existing `Start Listening` `<Link>` opening tag

The commit **does not contain** any of the following:

- No `HOME_FEATURED_TRACKS` array constant
- No `index === 0 ? 'md:col-span-2 lg:col-span-3' : ''` grid-span change on the featured card
- No `h-20 w-20 sm:h-24 sm:w-24` first-card image-size change
- No `text-lg md:text-xl` first-card title-size change
- No `Featured track` label addition
- No `sizes={index === 0 ? ... }` change

### Probable cause of the HOLD PUSH

Codex appears to have inspected the working tree (which still has OD's pre-existing `HOME_FEATURED_TRACKS` reshape restored on top of `HEAD` per Option A from the prior pass) rather than the commit itself. `git diff origin/main -- src/app/page.tsx` against the working tree would surface both the auth CTA changes (in HEAD) and the uncommitted reshape (working tree only) in one combined diff, which would read as if the reshape were part of the commit. `git show HEAD -- src/app/page.tsx` is the authoritative view of the commit, and it shows only the auth CTA work.

### Decision

No reset or commit rewrite was performed. Rewriting a commit that is already in the desired state would either be a no-op or an unnecessary risk to a passing build. Per OD's Option 1 directive: confirm and skip the rewrite.

### State after this clarification

- `src/app/page.tsx` in HEAD: auth CTA only, attributed to Bucket A.
- `src/app/page.tsx` in working tree: HEAD content + OD's pre-existing `HOME_FEATURED_TRACKS` reshape restored from backup. Reshape is uncommitted and remains for OD to handle separately.
- All other Bucket A files in HEAD as expected.
- Branch is `main`. Branch is local only — no `git push` was run.
- No deploy step was run.

Build continues to pass (verification log below).

### Verification commands run for this clarification

```
git show --name-only HEAD
git diff HEAD -- src/app/page.tsx
git status --short
npm run build
