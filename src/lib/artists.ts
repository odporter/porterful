    bio: `O D Porter is a St. Louis-born artist who grew up between the音乐 of New Orleans and the streets of the Lou. Born in Miami, raised between NOLA and the Lou — most known from the STL.

After years of grinding in the underground, O D Porter built Porterful out of frustration. Frustration with platforms that take 80% of what artists earn. Frustration with labels that own your work before you see a dollar. Frustration with watching money leave the community within 24 hours.

He wrote his story down — the real one, unfiltered — in his book "There It Is, Here It Go." It's the story of a kid who refused to quit even when everything said stop. Loss in the family. Momentum derailed. And then the stubbornness kicked in.

That stubbornness is the through-line. When O D Porter sets his mind to something, it gets done. Porterful is proof — a platform where artists keep 80%+, where superfans earn 3% on everything their referrals buy, where money recirculates through the community instead of leaking out.

The plan: make Porterful the artist's retirement. Build it once, let it work forever.`,

    location: 'St. Louis, MO',
    bio: `Gune is what happens when you give a St. Louis kid a drum machine and tell him he can't make it. He made it anyway.

Raw, unapologetic hip-hop from the Lou — the kind that comes from living it, not watching it through a screen. Gune brings a sound that cuts through the noise: hard drums,mean bass lines, and lyrics that don't flinch.

On Porterful, he's not competing with the algorithm. He's building something real with fans who actually show up. 80% of every sale goes straight to the artist. Gune's keeping every cent of that.`,

    bio: `Nikee Turbo is the St. Louis rapper who turned rhythm into a movement. Featured in the Riverfront Times for his distinctive flow — the kind that inspired a dance craze before the algorithm caught on.

He's proof that in the Lou, we don't wait for permission. We build our own thing and let the world catch up. His rhythm-first approach to hip-hop has earned him a following that's more like a movement.

On Porterful, Nikee Turbo's fans are superfans — earning rewards every time they bring someone new to the platform. Because in St. Louis, we look out for our own.`,

    genre: 'Hip-Hop / R&B / Blues',
    location: 'St. Louis, MO',
    bio: `Rob Soule is a St. Louis hip-hop and R&B artist bringing a sound you don't hear every day — one that blends the blues into something raw and soulful. Born and raised in the Lou, he grew up on the city's sounds: the soul, the struggle, the stories that come from living it. He didn't just absorb that — he translated it into something new.

His music sits at the intersection where hip-hop meets the blues. Where the 808 meets the guitar. Where the street meets the soul. It's St. Louis music because it could only come from here — from the blocks, the history, the people. The result is a soulful sound rooted in the blues, filtered through hip-hop and R&B.

Rob's been building his sound track by track, learning what works and what doesn't, and Porterful is where he's planting his flag. This is STL music for STL people and everyone else who can feel it.`,
