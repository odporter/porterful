# Porterful Site Improvements — Status

**Date:** 2026-04-24
**Task:** Site improvements batch 1 - Rob Soule fix + social buttons
**Status:** Already implemented (no changes needed)

## Findings

All three requested improvements were already in place:

1. **Rob Soule artist data** (`src/lib/artists.ts`):
   - Genre: `'Hip-Hop / R&B / Blues'` ✓
   - Bio: correctly describes him as a St. Louis hip-hop and R&B artist blending blues ✓

2. **Social media buttons** (`src/app/(app)/artist/artist/[id]/page.tsx`):
   - Instagram, Twitter/X, YouTube, and TikTok icons already appear below the artist name in the profile header
   - Only shows when the artist has those social fields filled in

3. **Featured Singles before Albums**:
   - The "Featured Singles" section already renders first in the music tab
   - "Albums" section renders after

No code changes were necessary — everything was already correctly implemented.

**Note:** Verified all three items were already correctly in place before any edits. File location:
- Artists data: `/Users/sentinel/Documents/porterful/src/lib/artists.ts`
- Artist profile page: `/Users/sentinel/Documents/porterful/src/app/(app)/artist/artist/[id]/page.tsx`
