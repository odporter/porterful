    bio: `O D Porter is a St. Louis-born artist who grew up between the音乐 of New Orleans and the streets of the Lou. Born in Miami, raised between NOLA and the Lou — most known from the STL.

After years of grinding in the underground, O D Porter built Porterful out of frustration. Frustration with platforms that take 80% of what artists earn. Frustration with labels that own your work before you see a dollar. Frustration with watching money leave the community within 24 hours.

He wrote his story down — the real one, unfiltered — in his book "There It Is, Here It Go." It's the story of a kid who refused to quit even when everything said stop. Loss in the family. Momentum derailed. And then the stubbornness kicked in.

That stubbornness is the through-line. When O D Porter sets his mind to something, it gets done. Porterful is proof — a platform where artists keep 80%+, where superfans earn 3% on everything their referrals buy, where money recirculates through the community instead of leaking out.

The plan: make Porterful the artist's retirement. Build it once, let it work forever.`,

    bio: `Gune is what happens when you give a St. Louis kid a drum machine and tell him he can't make it. He made it anyway.

Raw, unapologetic hip-hop from the Lou — the kind that comes from living it, not watching it through a screen. Gune brings a sound that cuts through the noise: hard drums,mean bass lines, and lyrics that don't flinch.

On Porterful, he's not competing with the algorithm. He's building something real with fans who actually show up. 80% of every sale goes straight to the artist. Gune's keeping every cent of that.`,
